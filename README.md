# Use at your own risk. For learning purposes.

Make sure you download VMProtect Demo and protect the compiled file. You'll get banned otherwise. To use VMProtect, open it, drop your file in it, click the second 'star' icon on the left panel that says functions, choose EntryPoint then on the right side under Protection category you want to use the mouse wheel to move it from None to Ultra (Mutation+Virtualization). Click the start button to compile it, click no to saving and running it now, then close vmp. You can rename the file after this from e.g. example.vmp.exe to whatever.exe. Use this file only.

Insert opens and closes menu. Open cheat, open overwatch, go into practice range.
